To build r11 library:
    You must be on workstation running sol 7 
    You must be in Cfiles directory
    type "make r11"
To build r12 or r14_3 libraries:
    You must be on workstation running sol 8 
    You must be in Cfiles directory
    type either "make r12" or "make r14_3"
To build LINUX library:
    you must be on Linux workstation
    you must be in Cfiles directory
    type either "/usr/bin/make linux" or "/usr/bin/make linux_r14_3"

The fftw.a and rfftw.a files were compiled in R11 and get statically linked into the R11 library.

In R12, R14, and Linux, the fftw libraries are dynamically linked into the library from /ltx/lib.

-----------------------------------------------
New data types:

The changes to CCC that allow new data types (including strings) and the new bifs
that allow CCC to be called from the background were released in R14.3.0. This required
the new version of c_library.h. There are now two include files:

    c_library.h		The original include file
    c_library.R14.3.h	The include file that is in the R14.3.0 build

-------------
STRING Variables:

Prior to R14.3, it was not possible to pass Cadence string variables to a CCC library.
When it was required to do so, a string was packed into an integer array and the integer
array was passed to the library. Two Cadence procedures are supplied in verify.tp for 
dealing with this:

     ltx_atoi:
         Takes a Cadence string and packs it into an integer array. A third
         boolean variable is set to true to terminate the string with a LF character
         or if false, to terminate it with a zero.

     ltx_itoa:
         Takes an integer array and unpacks characters into a string variable. A
         third variable specifies the maximum number of characters to take out of the integer
         array.

Identical C functions are provided in MyLib.c to unpack ascii characters from an integer
array into a char array and to pack characters from a char array into an integer array:

     ltx_atoi:
         Takes a C char array and packs it into an integer array until it finds either
         a '\n' or a '\0' in the character array.

     ltx_itoa:
         Takes an integer array and unpacks characters into a C char array until it
         finds either an '\n' or '\0' character. If a '\n' character is detected, it is packed
         into the char array and is followed by a '\0' character.

Use of strings is shown in the sample code through library functions MyQuickFoxOld and MyQuickFoxNew. In Cadence, a 
string containing "The quick brown fox " is sent to both functions in the library and they append
"over the lazy dog." to it. MyQuickFoxOld demonstrates the use of the ltx_atoi and ltx_itoa procedures/functions on both ends to
pass string data as integers while MyQuickFoxNew demonstrates the use of passing Cadence string variables to the library.

NOTICE: that the function MyQuickFoxNew function has #ifdef R14_3 around most of the code. This
is necessary when compiling the MyLibrary.c file for OS's prior to R14.3 since there is no STRING definition
in the c_library.h file and a Compile error would occur otherwise.

-----------------
Log Files:

Often while debugging a library, it is convenient to log data to a log file. It is generally not
desirable to log debugging data during production runs since it adds execution overhead to the library call,
however you may wish to maintain a log file during production testing to log real errors that the 
library may detect.

The MyLibrary.c file contains 4 functions as a sample for dealing with log files. These are:

    MyOpenLogNew: This function can be called from Cadence to open a log file. It is passed a
                  Cadence string with the name of the log file (in the sample code /tmp/MyLog.txt
                  is the log file). It should be used when running in R14_3 or later. See NOTICE 
                  above regarding the use of #ifdef R14_3 within the function.

    MyOpenLogOld: This function can also be called from Cadence to open a log file. It is passed a
                  Cadence integer array with the name of the log file. It must be used when running in
                  an OS prior to R14_3.

    MyCloseLog:   This function can be called from Cadence to close any previously opened log file.

    writeToLog:   This function can be called from anywhere within the library software to write
                  a message to the log file. There are a couple samples of how this would be called
                  within the MyLibrary.c file.

The /tmp directory is not a good place to keep log files since they are deleted upon re-booting the workstation.
For debugging, they probably are OK, but for error logging, it is reccommended to use the
/ltx/testers/tester_name/log directory.

LTX SHAREWARE LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

    Version 1.1
    January 20, 2006

  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
distributed under the terms of this LTX Shareware License.  The
"Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based
on the Program" means either the Program or any work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each
licensee is addressed as "you".

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
LTX Shareware License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
other recipients of the Program a copy of this LTX Shareware License
along with the Program.   LTX Shareware Programs may only be distributed
to customers of LTX Corporation.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph
1 above, provided that you also do the following:

    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
    you changed the files and the date of any change; and

    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that
    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either
    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to LTX
    and to all LTX Customers under the terms of this LTX Shareware License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this LTX
    Shareware License.

Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its
derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
the other work under the scope of these terms.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of
it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    b) accompany it with a written offer to give any LTX Customer free
    (except for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed
    under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)

Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special
exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard
libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable
file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that
accompany that operating system.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
Program except as expressly provided under this LTX Shareware License.
Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer
the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use
the Program under this License.  However, parties who have received
copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this LTX Shareware
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
remain in full compliance.

  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based
on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,
and all its terms and conditions.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these
terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the
recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.

  7. LTX Corporation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the LTX Shareware License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by LTX Corporation.
If the Program does not specify a version number of
the license, you may choose any version ever published by LTX
Corporation.

                            NO WARRANTY

  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
