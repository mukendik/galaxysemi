To build r11 library:
    You must be on workstation running sol 7 
    type "make r11"
To build r12 or r14_3 libraries:
    You must be on workstation running sol 8 
    type either "make r12" or "make r14_3"
To build LINUX library:
    you must be on Linux workstation
    type either "/usr/bin/make linux" or "/usr/bin/make linux_r14_3"

-----------------------------------------------

NOTICE: that the functions have #ifdef R14_3 around most of the code. This
is necessary when compiling file for OS's prior to R14.3 since there is no STRING definition
in the c_library.h file and a Compile error would occur otherwise.
