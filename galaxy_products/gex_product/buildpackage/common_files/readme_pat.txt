During the validity period of your GEX licenses, you can
download and install any new release posted on the Quantix web site.
Installation is simple as all you need is to overwrite your old
release!

About GEX-LM: If you upgrade your GEX server software, then 
first terminate/kill the GEX-LM application. It will also force 
all existing GEX nodes to close. Once the new GEX-LM is installed,
simply launch it to let GEX nodes connect again.
