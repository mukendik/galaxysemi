      Object Info</b>: Select this icon,&nbsp; then click any object to display
      its information. It will give you a sharp and detailed description of your
      selection (e.g.: die location, binning, failing test, test statistics,
      etc.). Or click the background to have global information about the file
      processed, yield data, etc...</p>
      <p align="left"><img border="0" src="../images/drill3d_zoom.png" width="18" height="17">
      <b>Zoom</b>: Click this icon to enter in zoom mode. Then Left click on any
      object to zoom in on it, or Right click to zoom out. Also CTRL+Left click
      switches from Zoom to select object mode. This is very convenient as you
      usually end a zooming sequence by selecting an object and see its
      information.</p>
      <p align="left"><a name="navigate"></a><img border="0" src="../images/drill3d_move.png" width="28" height="26">
      <b>Move</b>: Click this icon to enter in Image Move mode. Then click and
      drag any object of the 3D window to have all the image shifted. Drag to
      the left to have the image shift to the left, up to shift up, etc. If you
      keep the Control key (<b>CTRL</b>) down while dragging the mouse, you'll perform
      a view <b>Rotate</b> instead (very convenient for multiple Rotate/Moves sequences).</p>
      <p align="left"><img border="0" src="../images/drill3d_rotate.png" width="23" height="23">
      <b>Rotate</b>: Click this icon to enter in Image Rotation mode. Then
      click and drag any object of the 3D window to have all the image rotated.
      Drag to the left to have the image rotate to the left, up to rotate up,
      etc. If you keep the Control key (CTRL) down while dragging the mouse,
      you'll perform a view <b>Move</b> instead (very convenient for multiple
      Rotate/Moves sequences).</p>
      <p align="left"><img border="0" src="../images/drill3d_fullscreen.png" width="20" height="20">
      <b>Full Screen</b>: Click this icon to have the 3D window cover all the
      GEX interface, click on it again to toggle back to standard size within
      the GEX interface. The Full Screen mode makes navigation more comfortable,
      it brings sharper details rendering. This selection is also available from
      the context menu (mouse right click)</p>
      <p align="left"><a name="snapshot"></a><img border="0" src="../images/drill3d_snapshot.png" width="24" height="18">
      <b>Snapshot</b>: Click this icon to take a snapshot of the 3D window,
      and have it added to your report Snapshot Gallery section.&nbsp; This
      selection is also available from the context menu (mouse right click).</p>
      <p align="left"><a name="bookmark"></a><img border="0" src="../images/drill3d_bookmark.png" width="20" height="21">
      <b>Bookmark Home location</b>: Click this icon to have GEX record your
      current view point (position in space, and zoom angle). Can also be done
      pressing the <b>B </b>key.&nbsp; This selection is also available from the
      context menu (mouse right click).</p>
      <p align="left"><img border="0" src="../images/drill3d_home.png" width="19" height="20">
      <b>Go Home</b>: Click this icon to go back to the view point position
      you book marked with the <a href="#bookmark">above</a> bookmark icon. If
      no previous position was book marked, GEX reloads the original view point
      and zoom at assistant startup time. Can also be done pressing the <b>H </b>key.&nbsp;
      This selection is also available from the context menu (mouse right
      click).</p>
      To make the image <b>Spin</b>, select the Move icon, then click any object
      in the 3D window and 'throw' it using the mouse (drag the object with the
      mouse clicked, then release the mouse button while still dragging the
      mouse). The spinning speed depends on how firmly you 'threw' the object! The
      spinning axis is always orthogonal to the mouse direction at the time of
      throw. To stop the spin, click any location in the image.
