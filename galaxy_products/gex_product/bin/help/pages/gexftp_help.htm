<p><span lang="en-us">This application is a companion to Examinator-Monitoring
and is designed to get test data files from remote servers, and ftp them to the
local Examinator Monitoring server. Prior to install and run this application, we assume 
that your Examinator-Monitoring module is already installed and works properly 
(it must have at least one&nbsp; <b><i>DataPump</i></b> task and the <b><i>
Create Web Status</i></b> task created).</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">The Examinator FTP Client application includes the following 
menus in its toolbar:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li><span lang="en-us">Help</span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-us">General</span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-us">FTP</span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-us">Activity log</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="en-us">These menus have the following purpose:</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><b>Help</b>: Includes the HTML on-line help documentation, 
details how to setup the application to have the test data files correctly
retrieved from one or several remote servers, and ftp'd to the local Examinator
Monitoring server.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><b>General</b>: Lets you define how often the tool should
scan the remote server(s) for test data files to transfer.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><b>FTP</b>: Lets you define several remote servers from
which you want to retrieve test data files.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><b>Activity log</b>: Logs exceptions such as errors while
getting files from remote servers. The log file doesn't require 
any purge admin as it automatically removes any exception older than 1 week.<br>
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">When all settings have been set, click the <b><i>Save 
Settings</i></b> button to save information on disk.</span></p>

<p><span lang="en-us">To have Examinator FTP client correctly retrieve test data
files from one or several remote servers, you need to:</span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span lang="en-us">Have your Examinator-Monitoring module installed and

(it must have at least one&nbsp; <b><i>DataPump</i></b> task and the <b><i>

</ol>
<p><span lang="en-us"> When running the FTP client in manual mode (started from the Windows Start
menu &quot;Start-&gt;Quantix
Examinator Monitoring-&gt;Ftp service&quot;, user interface visible), you must click the <b><i>
Start</i></b> button in order to start the ftp spooling process. Unless you 
click the <b><i>Start</i></b> button, the application doesn't scan the remote
servers! Once started, you can stop it at any time clicking again the 
same button (toggle Start/Stop function).</span></p>

<hr>
<h1><span lang="en-us"><a name="WindowsService">Installing the application as a
Windows service</a></span></h1>
<p><span lang="en-us"> Once you have entered all the 
appropriate setup information, it is recommended that you first start the
spooling process in Manual running mode (using the Windows Start menu
&quot;Start-&gt;Quantix
Examinator Monitoring-&gt;Ftp service&quot;), and have it transfer a few files
from one or all of the defined remote servers, so to make sure all FTP settings
are working, and files correctly transferred to the local Examinator Monitoring
server. Then you may install the application as a Windows service, using the following
procedure:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li><span lang="en-us">exit the application if it is running (clicking the <b><i>Exit</i></b>
    button)</span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-us">install the application as a Windows service using
    command line &quot;gex-ftp.exe -i&quot;</span></li>
  <li><span lang="en-us">start the installed service using command line &quot;gex-ftp.exe
    -e&quot;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="en-us">Once the application is installed as a Windows service, it
will automatically be started on system boot. You don't need to be logged to the
system for the service to start, and when you logout, the service doesn't stop.
The application runs in background with no visible user interface. You may use
the <b><i>Pause</i></b> function from the Windows Services control panel, or the
command line &quot;gex-ftp.exe -p&quot;. This
brings up the application's GUI, enabling you to eventually stop the spooler,
change/save some settings, and restart the spooler. Using the <b><i>Resume</i></b>
function from the Windows Services control panel, or the command line &quot;gex-ftp.exe
-r&quot; will hide the GUI, and the application will continue in the background.</span></p>

<h1><span lang="en-us"><a name="WindowsServiceConfig">Modifying the settings of
a GEX-FTP instance running as a Windows Service</a></span></h1>
<p>This section describes how to modify the setup of a GEX-FTP application
running as a Windows service.</p>
<h2>Local login</h2>
<p>If you are logged on the server running the GEX-FTP service:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Launch the Windows Services control panel (Windows Control
    Panel-&gt;Administrative Tools-&gt;Services)</li>
  <li>Select the &quot;Examinator GEX-FTP Vx.y&quot;&nbsp; service</li>
  <li>Pause the service using the 'Pause Service' button, or the mouse
    right-click</li>
  <li>The GEX-FTP GUI will be displayed (if you cannot see it, click it's icon
    in the Taskbar)</li>
  <li>Stop the spooling process by clicking the 'Stop' button</li>
  <li>Modify your settings ('General' and 'Ftp' sections)</li>
  <li>Save your settings by clicking the 'Save settings' button</li>
  <li>Check the 'Activity log' section to make sure no error occurred during the
    save</li>
  <li>Re-start the spooling process by clicking the 'Start' button</li>
  <li>In the Windows Services control panel, resume the GEX-FTP service by using
    the 'Resume service' button, or the mouse right-click</li>
</ol>
<h2>Remote login with Windows Terminal Services</h2>
<p>This section describes how to modify the GEX-FTP settings when the service is
installed on a server running Windows Terminal Services, and you are connected
to the server running the GEX-FTP service through a Windows Terminal Services
client/server connection. The specificity of this situation is that if you pause
the service, the GEX-FTP GUI will be displayed on the console of the server, but
not on your terminal. This is because the GUI runs under the local service
account, and this account has no access to the screen real estate of the user
logged in via Windows Terminal Services. If the GEX-FTP application is started
manually, the directory holding it's settings and log files is different from
the one used by the GEX-FTP service (for obvious access privileges reasons). To
workaround this situation, GEX-FTP includes, when started manually on a system
having the GEX-FTP service installed, a 'Service' tab, that enables you to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>stop the service</li>
  <li>load its settings file</li>
  <li>save current settings to its settings file</li>
  <li>display the service's log file</li>
</ul>
<p>The process is as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Manually launch GEX-FTP using 'Windows Start menu-&gt;Programs-&gt;Quantix
    Examinator Monitoring-&gt;Ftp service'</li>
  <li>Select the 'Service' section (if you cannot see any 'Service' section in
    the left pane, this means that the service is not installed)</li>
  <li>If the service is running, stop it by clicking the 'Stop service' button</li>
  <li>Make sure the 'Service home directory' is correctly set. If not, select
    the correct directory using the 'Select the service home directory' button.
    If this directory is correctly set, the 'Load from service settings' button
    should be enabled when the service has been stopped. If you are not sure of
    the directory, search for the .gex_ftp.conf file on the server hard drive.
    It should be either in the Windows directory, or in the home directory of
    the local service account. Don't use your local home directory, which may
    also contain a .gex_ftp.conf file.</li>
  <li>Load the settings used by the service by clicking the 'Load from service
    settings' button</li>
  <li>Modify the settings ('General' and 'Ftp' sections)</li>
  <li>You can test the new settings by starting the spooler ('Start' button).
    Then click the 'Status' tab in the 'Ftp' section. Once the spooler has
    finished checking all Ftp sites you configured, or you aborted the process,
    stop the spooler by clicking the 'Stop' button</li>
  <li>Save the new settings to the settings file used by the service by clicking
    the 'Save to service settings' button in the 'Service' section.</li>
  <li>Re-start the service by clicking the 'Start service' button, and check the
    'Service log' to make sure the service started correctly</li>
  <li>You may save the settings locally (in your user home directory) by
    clicking the 'Save settings' button</li>
</ol>
