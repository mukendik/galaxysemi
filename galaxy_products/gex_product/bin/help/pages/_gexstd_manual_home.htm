          Use this link when you want to compare two or more files to each 
          other. This is typically for correlation analysis when you want to 
          compare results from different testers, different program releases, 
          etc.. This assistant generates report sections that let you quickly 
          identify anomalies and helps you improve your process.&nbsp;<br>

          process the resulting data as if it were one big file. This is useful 
          when combining multiple lots, and/or when looking for tests that never

          test programs in order to suppress them from your test flow.<br>
