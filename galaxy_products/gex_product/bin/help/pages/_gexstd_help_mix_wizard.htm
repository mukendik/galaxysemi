      Compare groups of files<br>
      </b><img border="0" src="../../html/images/ruler.png" width="616" height="8">
      </h1>
      <p align="left">To compare groups of files, all you have to do is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><b>1: </b>Launch the <a href="#_gex_wizard_mix_files.htm">
          <b>Compare groups of files</b></a><b> </b>assistant and create the 
          groups&nbsp;to compare.</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><b>2: </b>Select the files to process. Note that files 
          are added to the group selected prior to clicking the 'add files' 
          icon. All data files from the same group are merged into one big data 
          cluster, and then each data cluster from each group is compared to the 
          other groups. For example, this assistant allows you to compare many 
          lots tested under different conditions and lets you easily compare the 
          results.</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><b>3: </b>Edit the filter by double clicking a&nbsp;file 
          name (or clicking the properties button) to edit which test site to 
          process, and/or which parts to analyze (e.g. Bin1 only, Failures only, 
          specific list of parts, etc.). Repeat this for each file as 
          necessary.</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><b>4: </b>Go to next assistant page to define what to
          include
          in your report (<a href="_gexstd_manual_settings.htm">settings</a>),
          then have it created. Default report includes
          test statistics tables, Soft bin wafermap, and histogram of all tests.</li>
      </ul>

      </h1>
      <p align="left">You may find it very convenient to import all files that
      match a date and filters criteria. This very powerful function lets you
      only import test data coming from files generated between specific
      starting and ending dates. Furthermore, you can also define filters such
      as tester name, lot name, device type etc... For full details about this
      function, check the <a href="_gexstd_smart_import.htm">Smart Import</a> page.</p>

      <p align="left">Examinator allows you to save your list of files and 
      filters to disk so you can later reload it with just one mouse click! This 
      is a very convenient feature that boosts your productivity on repetitive 
      tasks involving the same data files.</p>

      </b><img border="0" src="../../html/images/ruler.png" width="616" height="8"></h1>
      <p>When editing the file properties to view data file details and/or
      change the  parts and sites to process, the following dialog box appears:</p>

<h1 align="left"><b>Map Test Numbers<br>
      </b><img border="0" src="../../html/images/ruler.png" width="616" height="8"></h1>
<p align="left">From the Properties page, you can select a text file (comma 
separated format) that includes the list of tests to map to new test indexes. 
This is quite useful when you need to compare data files created on different 
test environment, or need to merge files with test numbers no longer matching 
because of new tests added. Full details about the file format can be found in 
the relevant <a href="../script/gex3.htm#Mapping Test numbers">scripting section</a></p>
