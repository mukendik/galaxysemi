      </b><img border="0" src="../../html/images/ruler.png" width="616" height="8">
      </h1>
      <p align="left">To compare data from multiple files, all you have to do is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><b>1:</b> Launch the <a href="#_gex_wizard_compare_files.htm">
          <b>Compare files</b></a> assistant and select the files you want to 
          process. If multiple files are located in the same directory, you can 
          select them all at once holding the CTRL key while you select each 
          file; this performs multiple selections from the dialog box.</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><b>2: </b>Edit the filter by double clicking a file 
          name (or click the properties button) to edit which test site to 
          process, and/or which parts to analyze (e.g. Bin1 only, Failures only, 
          specific list of parts, etc.). Repeat this for each file as 
          necessary. To compare data from different sites within the same file, 
          insert the same file multiple times in the list and set the filter to 
          a specific site for each file entry; this allows you to compare 
          multi-site data within the same file!</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><b>3: </b>Go to next assistant page to define what to
          include in your report (<a href="_gexstd_manual_settings.htm">settings</a>),
          then have it created. Default report includes
          test statistics tables, Soft bin wafermap, and histogram of all tests.</li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left">For more details, see  the <a href="_gexstd_manual_files.htm">
      <b>'Data'</b> tab description</a></p>
      <p align="left">The following screenshot illustrates the sequence of steps to follow:</p>

      <h1><b>Merge files analysis: Date and filters<br>
      </b><img border="0" src="../../html/images/ruler.png" width="616" height="8">
      </h1>
      <p align="left">When using the merge file assistant, you will find a very
      convenient icon to import all files that match a date and filters
      criteria. This very powerful function lets you only import test data
      coming from files generated between specific starting and ending
      dates. Furthermore, you can also define filters such as tester name, lot
      name, device type etc... For full details about this function, check the <a href="_gexstd_smart_import.htm">Smart
      Import</a> page.</p>

      <h1>Load<b>/Save your File List<br>
      </b><img border="0" src="../../html/images/ruler.png" width="616" height="8"></h1>
      <p align="left">Examinator allows you to save your list of files and 
      filters to disk so you can later reload it with just one mouse click! This 
      is a very convenient feature that boosts your productivity on repetitive 
      tasks involving the same data files.</p>
      <p align="left"><a href="smart_import.htm">

      <h1><b>Filter: Parts and Sites to process<br>
      </b><img border="0" src="../../html/images/ruler.png" width="616" height="8"></h1>
      <p>When editing the file properties to view data file details and/or 
      change the  parts and sites to process, the following dialog box 
      appears:</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="../images/filter_cmp.png" width="600" height="347"></p>
<h1 align="left"><b>Map Test Numbers<br>
      </b><img border="0" src="../../html/images/ruler.png" width="616" height="8"></h1>
<p align="left">From the Properties page, you can select a text file (comma 
separated format) that includes the list of tests to map to new test indexes. 
This is quite useful when you need to compare data files created on different 
test environment, or need to merge files with test numbers no longer matching 
because of new tests added. Full details about the file format can be found in 
the relevant <a href="../script/gex3.htm#Mapping Test numbers">scripting section</a></p>
