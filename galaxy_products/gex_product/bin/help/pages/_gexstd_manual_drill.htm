      </h1>
      <p>At the very beginning, Quantix Examinator only allowed one to create
      reports based on user settings (GEX-Instant Report module). It was not then possible to interact with
      the data and drill into different direction. The interactive 2D/3D Data
      Mining feature was added to fill this gap and complete the solution to
      become a powerful tool for engineering and production data analysis. </p>
      <p>Using the Data Mining and Yield Analysis features, you can interact with your data and view
      it under many different angles and conditions. This flexibility lets you
      manipulate your data with powerful yet easy-to-use tools. Then as you drill down
      and focus on specific information you can take screen snapshots at any
      time so they get added to the report <b>Snapshot Gallery</b>  section (to
      take a snapshot, all you need is to click the camera icon <img border="0" src="../images/snapshot.png" width="34" height="23">. This
      way, you can build your own gallery of charts/tables focused on specific data
      analysis. This electronic binder includes all custom charts snapshots you
      take, and can be shared easily with anyone thanks to the HTML report
      format!</p>

      <h1><b><a name="whatif"> Guard Banding</a><br>

      </h1>
      <p>This data mining option is the only one available <b>in both GEX-Instant
      Report and GEX-Data Mining</b> modules. It is maintained in GEX-Instant
      report for historical reasons (and lets users continue to benefit from it).
      When you select this option, GEX first processes your
      data so test statistics are computed (Cp, Cpk and Yield information). Then
      it will display a table like the following one:</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="../images/eg_drill_whatif.png" width="392" height="156"></p>
      <p>Double click any test Low or High limit cell to change it. Multiple
      limits can be changed at once as described <a href="#multiple">below</a>.</p>
      <p>The table lists all tests found in your data. For each test listed,
      the following information appear in individual cells:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Test</b>: This is the test number. This cell is read-only. Click
          on its header to sort all tests by ascending or descending order.</li>
        <li><b>Name</b>: This row includes the test names. It is a read-only
          row, and supports sorting as well.</li>
        <li><b>Low limit</b>: This row lists all tests low limits. You can
          change any of them to see the impact on the tests Cp anc Cpk. Once a
          cell is changed, its background color is turned to yellow so you can
          easily remember what you have changed. Sorting is not supported as it
          makes no sense.</li>
        <li><b>High limit</b>: Same as above but for the test high limits</li>
        <li><b>Cp</b>: This row lists all tests Cp values. You can change values
          as for the test limits. Sorting mode is supported.</li>
        <li><b>Cpk</b>: Same as above but for test Cpk values.</li>
        <li><b>Yield</b>: Read only row, lists current tests yield values.
          Sorting supported.</li>
        <li><b>Low limit (Ref)</b>: The original Low limit value, read-only.</li>
        <li><b>High limit (Ref)</b>: The original High limit value, read-only</li>
        <li><b>Cp (Ref)</b>: The original Cp value, read-only, supports sorting.</li>
        <li><b>Cpk (Ref)</b>: The original Cpk value, read-only, supports
          sorting.</li>
        <li><b>Yield (Ref)</b>: The original Yield value, read-only, supports
          sorting.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><br>
      <b>About Colors</b>: When you edit a test parameter (e.g.: Low Limit), then its
      cell turns to yellow to
      highlight your change. If you then change another test parameter for the
      same test (e.g.: Test limits), then it is the the last edited cell that
      turns to yellow while the other one returns to the default color. You will
      notice that only the color is turned back to the default value, while the
      cell text remains unchanged. At processing time (when 'Compute' button
      is clicked), only cells in yellow background are considered. All cells
      with the default background color use the test statistics information and
      ignore whatever string was placed in the table. This avoids complex and lengthy
      processing time if you modify many parameters for a same test: only the
      last edit is considered.&nbsp;<br>
      After processing your entry, the table will be updated and display in yellow
      (your <b>If</b> conditions - the parameters edited), and in green
      the affected data (the Then result - the new values computed).</p>

      you need to do is highlight the group of cells to edit (Click and drag the
      mouse), then type the value and press <b>return</b>. All selected cells
      are then highlighted to yellow and set to the same value you entered. This is
      quite convenient when forcing a group of cells to the same

      <p>'<b>Compute</b>' button : Click it to have Examinator update all table

      Click this icon at any time to capture the table into the report Snapshot
      Gallery. Only tests that you have edited are listed in the report. You can
      take as many snapshots as you want, they are always appended to the
      Gallery. Note: When you click this icon, a dialog box prompts you to enter
      the <b>Title</b> and <b>Notes</b> to be inserted in your snapshot page: <b>Title</b>
      is added to the snapshot home page and appears as an hyperlink to your
      snapshot page, the snapshot page includes the report table followed by
      your <b>Notes</b>. </p>
      <p><b>Reflect changes in all reports</b>: when you check this item, you 
      will have ALL the Examinator report sections show the new test limited 
      edited from this page and also show all the new test statistics values 
      updated (Mean, Sigma, Cp, Cpk, etc). Check this item when you want a 
      global simulation of your production behavior when some test limits are 
      changed. All HTML or CSV data are then fully updated.</p>
