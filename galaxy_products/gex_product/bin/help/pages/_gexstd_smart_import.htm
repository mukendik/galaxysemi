      <p align="left">The <b>Merge files</b> and <b>Compare groups of files</b> assistants include the Smart Import icon <img border="0" src="../images/file_opendate.png" width="26" height="25">&nbsp;
      that makes an automatic selection of all files that match a given time
      period (i.e.: data tested during this period). This function also lets you
      filter files based on information such as: tester name, program name, lot
      name, etc...</p>
      <p align="left">Following is a screenshot of the Smart Import assistant:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>From</b>: Lets you define the starting date (data tested prior to this
          date are ignored). You can enter the date using the date editor or
          click the calendar icon to browse and pick your date.</li>
        <li><b>To</b>: Same as above, but for the ending date (data tested after this
          date are ignored).</li>
        <li><b>File location path</b>: The software will look for data file starting
          from this directory. Sub directories will only be analyzed if the
          'Look in subfolders' option is checked. Enter your folder path, or
          click the browse button <b>'...'</b> to browse your disk and select a
          specific directory.</li>
        <li><b>Look in subfolders</b>: Instructs the software to look for data files in
          all subfolders too.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Filters are used to make a final decision if data matching the time
      period must be imported. To simplify entries and reduce typical case
      problems, filter strings entered <b>are not</b> case sensitive (the
      software makes no difference between uppercase and lowercase). Multiple filters conditions can be activated at
      once and include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Tester name</b>: lets you define a filter on the tester name. Keep it to
          * if you don't want to activate this filter, otherwise any string is
          valid, including wild characters such as * and ?. E.g.: <b>test??_*</b>
          will instruct the software to import test data matching the date
          period selected AND if data have been tested on a tester which name
          starts with the string <b>test</b> then includes <b>2</b> characters
          to ignore, then followed by a <b>underscore</b> character, then
          followed by <b>any type</b> of string.</li>
        <li><b>Device name</b>: Same as above except filter checks the device name (STDF
          part_type field)</li>
        <li><b>Program name</b>: Same as above except filter checks the test program
          name.</li>
        <li><b>Lot name</b>: Same as above except filter checks the lot name string.</li>
      </ul>
