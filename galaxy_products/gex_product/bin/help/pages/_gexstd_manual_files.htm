      <p align="left">Once you have selected a specific assistant from the home
      page, the <b>Data</b> page is displayed. Its layout will vary slightly
      depending on the assistant selected. If you select the assistant to analyze
      a single file, then the page will only let you select one file. If you
      select&nbsp; compare or merge files, you will be able to
      select multiple files and add them to the list. Lastly, if you select
      the assistant to compare groups of files, you get a dedicated button
      that lets you create and label groups.</p>
      <p align="left">On the <b>Data</b> page, you'll find some of the
      following icons:</p>

          matching a given criteria (date window, tester name, lot #, sub-lot #, 
          etc...). Very powerful and easy to use assistant to quickly process

            clicked remains selected.&nbsp;<br>
            When files are selected, the examinator assumes you plan to include
            all data found in the file (any site, any test result). If you want

            details (lot id, tester id, etc.), and define which test
            results to process (all data, good bin only, all sites, site X only,
