      <p>You may never need to write a single script while using Quantix 
      Examinator (Pro edition only), but you should be aware of all the power, and potential, 
      behind it. Quantix Examinator is totally built around a scripting engine, 
      when you run an assistant or edit your Options, all these actions are 
      scripts to the Examinator! This means that you can smoothly integrate the 
      Examinator into an automated process with very little effort. The 
      Examinator has been built around a scripting engine&nbsp;to ensure that 
      you do not have to compromise: Quantix Examinator will let you create the 
      most appropriate solutions allowing you to leverage all the scripting 
      functions.</p>
      <p>When you click the
      <img id="_x0000_i1026" src="../images/script.png" border="0" width="22" height="23">script 
      icon from the home page or the Examinator toolbar, you jump to the 
      scripting center page. This page is split in two zones: the left half 
      includes a list of favorite scripts, and the right half includes the 
      scripting console.</p>
      <p><b>Favorite scripts</b>: When first installed, the Examinator loads 
      this list with some ready-to-use script programs delivered with the 
      Examinator solution. These scripts are provided for your convenience and 
      you can change them as you wish to better suit your needs. Some of these 
      scripts show how to use message/prompt script functions, others focus on 
      the data analysis, while others like games are for your own amusement!<br>
      Here are the icons you'll use to operate/modify your list of favorite 
      scripts:</p>
      <table border="1" width="646">

      <p><b>Note:</b> When a script writes a message it is redirected to the 
      script console. This console supports a scroll bar so you can review an 
      important history list of the messages displayed. When the script is 
      prompting the user to input a string, an edit box will appear at the very 
      bottom of the console area. Once the text is entered, either hit the <b>
      return</b> key, or click the <b>Ok</b> button located at the right-hand 
      side of the text input window. If you wish to enter a complete file name 
      and path, click the browsing button that precedes the <b>Ok</b> button: it 
      will open a browser interface and ease the selection process!</p>
