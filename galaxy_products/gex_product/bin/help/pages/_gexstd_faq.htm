      <p align="left">This section includes the most common questions we have
      received from users. You can find more answers using <i>Neptus</i>, the
      Examinator Assistant!...or by visiting the Quantix web site: <b>

      </p>
      <p align="left">The Quantix Examinator solution supports both STDF V3 and STDF V4 file types. It also supports files generated by all types of workstation platforms (PC, Unix, DEC, etc). Therefore, any STDF file you have that complies with the STDF specification will work with Quantix Examinator.</p>

      <b>Missing info in the .CSV or HTML report<br>
      </b><img border="0" src="../../html/images/ruler.png" width="616" height="8">
      </p>
      <p align="left">Reports include all information that can be extracted from the data file. Depending on how the file was generated at the tester, some information may be missing. For example, when you do partial sampling in production, not all tested parts appear in the STDF file. In this case, the Histogram section would not be accurate because samples are missing. The same applies to the wafer map section; a wafer map is complete only if all die and binning information is present in the STDF file.</p>

      <b>Histogram only shows red bars, while I have good tests<br>
      </b><img border="0" src="../../html/images/ruler.png" width="616" height="8">
      </p>
      <p align="left">The histogram includes 18 bars. When a bar covers a range of test values that include both pass and fail values the bar will be red (fail). So in the event you have a small spread of test results, you may notice that a red bar is shown while some good values fit within this class.
      For precise histograms, use the Histogram Advanced chart report instead.
      It provides more advanced controls and precise resolution ... but requires a
      little more time to create!</p>
