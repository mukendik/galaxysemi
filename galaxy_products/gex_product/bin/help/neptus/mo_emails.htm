	  <p align="left">Yield-Man is designed to very easily integrate
      into your environment. As such, the mailing mechanism relies on robust
      technologies very simple to interact with. As a result, IT people will
      always find a simple way to have Monitoring emails smoothly travel through
      any custom mailing setup and firewall protections. Full details and
      ready-to-use applications can be found in Quantix's web site customer
      section:<br>
      <a href="http://support.galaxysemi.com">support.galaxysemi.com</a>&nbsp; 
      (password required, ask Quantix if you don't remember it).</p>
	  <p align="left">To achieve this, Yield-Man doesn't send emails but rather
      creates email events files! Such files are in ASCII and can then be
      processed by any third-party application or shell to &quot;push&quot; them into the
      company mailing system. The email events files are created in a dedicated
      folder under the Status Web root path defined in the Web Status task.<br>
      <br>
	  Yield-Man creates at least two files per email event in the folder:<br>
&nbsp;<b>&lt;StatusWebRootPath&gt;/examinator_monitoring/.emails</b>.<br>
      <br>
      These files are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
      <p align="left"><b>&lt;file_name&gt;.email</b> : ASCII file that includes email
      fields 'From', 'To', 'Subject', etc.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
      <p align="left"><b>&lt;file_name&gt;.body</b> : ASCII file that includes the email body
      to send</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p align="left">Other files may be created in the case email notification
      event is supposed to also attach documents or report files.</p>
      <p align="left">To have the email files sent as emails, you must install a
      small application or shell that polls the &lt;StatusWebRootPath&gt;/examinator_monitoring/.emails
      folder and looks for any .email file to process. Quantix has <b>ready-to-use
      mailing scripts and applications</b> available on request. Simply contact us
      to receive it!</p>
      <p align="left">Note: If you create your own shell or application to
      process the email event files, make sure that files are erased after being
      processed, including the .email , .body and attachment files!</p>
