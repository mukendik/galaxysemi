      <p align="left">Selecting files individually is fine as long as you
      perform engineering data analysis...but when its about production data,
      all you want is to manipulate data tested during a given time period, and
      matching&nbsp; certain criteria for the tester name, lot name, program
      name and device type.&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">Quantix Examinator includes such a feature, and all it takes is just one mouse click to launch just such an assistant!</p>

      <p align="left">Let's say you want all data tested over a given time
      period. Also, let's say you only want data tested for a given lot and for
      a given tester. You would then do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p align="left">Run the '<a href="#_gex_wizard_merge_files.htm">Merge
          files</a>' assistant</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">Click the Smart Import (<img border="0" src="../images/file_opendate.png" width="26" height="25">
          icon)...you'll then have a dialog box that lets you define the two
          dates limits, the directory where STDF files are located, and
          filtering option such as: lot name, tester name, program name strings
          expected. For full details, see the <a href="../pages/_gexstd_smart_import.htm"> Smart Import</a> page.</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">Enter all the settings to be used by the Smart Import
          assistant then click ok.</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">The Smart Import assistant will scan your given
          directory (and sub-directories if selected) and look for all files
          that include data tested between your two dates, then check the filter
          strings. All files matching passing the Smart Import conditions will
          be automatically added to your list of files!</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">Click the <b>Next</b> button to review you report
          charts and tables to create, then click <b>Build Report!</b></li>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p align="left">Let's say you want to compare data from two time periods.
      This may consist of tens or hundreds of files...then how can you easily
      define these two sets of data and locate their files? Here too, thanks to
      the Smart Import assistant, it only requires few mouse clicks.</p>
      <p align="left">You would then do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p align="left">Run the '<a href="#_gex_wizard_mix_files.htm">Compare
          groups of&nbsp; files</a>' assistant</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">Create your two groups that will include your two
          clusters of data&nbsp;</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">For each group, do the following: Click the group name
          (so to have it selected and ensure files imported will go into that
          group). Click the Smart Import (<img border="0" src="../images/file_opendate.png" width="26" height="25">
          icon)...and follow the same steps as for the case study above: enter
          all your import settings and click ok.</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">Click the <b>Next</b> button to review you report
