      <p align="left">The Quantix Examinator Pro solution was designed with the 
      following goals in mind:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
      <p align="left">Engine: Relies Quantix Examinator's very fast and easy 
      to use engine</p>
        </li>
        <li>
      <p align="left">Data selection: Uses intuitive queries</p>
        </li>
        <li>
      <p align="left">Data collection: Provides a simple interface to easily 
      create data containers (database) where any types of data (test data, 
      simulation, design, ...) can be imported.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1 align="left">What is a Database?</h1>
      <p align="left">A database is a collection of files in a proprietary 
      format that converts the data you import so to be added to the existing 
      data collection. You may dump all your data into a single database (e.g.: 
      production database), or create different smaller databases with a 
      specific purpose (e.g.: QA database, or Wafer test database). In any case, 
      a simple way to think of a database is to visualize a collection of data 
      into a folder...the folder being the database name!</p>
      <p align="left">Examinator Pro's approach with Databases was so as not to rely on 
      Oracle or any generic database provider andf thereby eliminate the significant 
      overhead of generic SQL queries. Examinator Pro&nbsp; is using a much more 
      straightforward and efficient way to deal with your data: all the data 
      files you import in a Examinator Pro database are  copied to the 
      database folder and kept <b>unchanged</b>! This guarantees <b>full availability</b> of 
      the information stored in your data files, and eliminates the unpleasant surprise 
      of parsers that silently ignore key information when  importing your 
      file! <br>
&nbsp;</p>
      <h1 align="left">How does it work?</h1>
      <p align="left">Examinator Pro allows you to create and work with databases 
      that are either local (your account) or on the server. Each database can 
      hold as much data as you want...the only limit being your disk size!</p>
      <p align="left">The purpose of <b>local</b> databases is when you are 
      conducting data analysis on your own, with no need to share with others. 
      The Examinator Pro interface will list your local databases, but other users 
      won't have access to it. This mode also allows faster data analysis as 
      data and queries are all executed locally <a href="db_local-server.htm">
      [more]</a>.</p>
      <p align="left">The purpose of <b>server</b> databases is when data need 
      to be accessed by different people and teams, and also when you want to 
      have real-time information reporting (e.g: production line on-line Yield 
      HTML report) <a href="db_local-server.htm">[more]</a>.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
      <h1 align="left">Databases Names?</h1>
      <p align="left">Databases names can include any character, there is <b>no 
      restriction</b> in the characters to be used or the string length 
      specified! The associated folder Examinator Pro creates is the same name 
      except that all invalid characters for a folder name are replaced with the 
      underscore '_' character. As such, the database <b>My Data (1)</b> will be 
      saved under the folder name <b>My_Data_1_</b> <br>
&nbsp;</p>
      <h1 align="left">Databases Parameters / Tests</h1>
      <p align="left">Because Quantix's focus remains the semiconductor industry, 
      parameters manipulated are called tests. This is simply a terminological
      choice, and doesn't bring any limitation in what you can accomplish.&nbsp; 
      The solutions from Quantix support the following data types where any 
      parameter is assigned a test number :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
      <p align="left">WIP Lot and Wafer History </p>
        </li>
        <li>
      <p align="left">Inline Lot and Wafer Metrology Measurements</p>
        </li>
        <li>
      <p align="left">Electrical Test&nbsp; (E-Test)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
      <p align="left">Wafer Sort</p>
        </li>
        <li>
      <p align="left">Assembly </p>
        </li>
        <li>
      <p align="left">Final Test</p>
        </li>
        <li>
      <p align="left">And Non-Lot Equipment Measurements (simulation data, CSV 
      files, etc.)</p>
        </li>
