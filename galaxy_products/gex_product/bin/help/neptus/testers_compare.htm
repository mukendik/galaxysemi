      <p align="left">Prerequisites: To compare testers, one typical process
      consists in testing a golden device in loop at each tester so to create a
      repeatability data file. For a statistically valid analysis, each golden
      device should be tested at least 30 times; many prefer to loop 100 times
      so as to ensure enough samples, and increase the statistical results accuracy.</p>
      <p align="left">To perform a correlation analysis between testers, do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p align="left">Click the <a href="#_gex_wizard_compare_files.htm">Compare
          files</a> from the home page</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">Select all the repeatability files you want to involve
          in your correlation analysis (usually is one file per tester).</li>
        <li>
          <p align="left">Click the <b>Next</b> button to display the report
          settings page and select all the report sections you want</li>
      </ul>
          <p align="left">Note: When comparing files, the histograms report may
          take a while to build all the HTML pages as each test histogram has to
          draw and overlay data from each file. This process can take a minute
          or so if many tests are involved. Therefore, you may sometimes want to
          disable the histogram generation when focusing on other reports and
          looking for fastest data processing speed!
