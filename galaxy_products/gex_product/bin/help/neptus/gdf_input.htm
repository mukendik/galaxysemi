      <p align="left">The Examinator product line supports test data files in native 
      Agilent GDF format. This is an ASCII format used by many Agilent testers 
      (HP83000, HP93000). While Agilent had originally developed a GDF to STDF 
      converter, it never released a stable version to all its users...and this 
      tool is no longer supported anymore. So with Quantix, you can now fully 
      leverage all the information stored in your data file, and should you have 
      any issue, we will support you!</p>
      <p align="left">On recent Agilent testers, test results resulting from 
      test methods usage are not logged to the GDF files...so consider GDF as a 
      backdoor if you need to perform data analysis and you are not able to have 
      your Agilent tester create a valid STDF file </p>
      <p align="left">Because Examinator supports the native GDF data format, 
      you do not need any parser or third-party software to process it! Simply select the files you want to process -  it's that simple!</p>
