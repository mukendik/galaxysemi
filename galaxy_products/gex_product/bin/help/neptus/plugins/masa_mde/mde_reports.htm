<p><font size="4"><b>The MDE report page</b></font></p>

<p>From the <b> main report page</b>, the user can access either the standard <b>Examinator
report page</b> or the <b>MASA MDE report page</b>. However, some links allow to
navigate between&nbsp; the <b>mutivariate analysis results</b> provided in the <b>MASA
MDE report page</b> and the <b>univariate analysis results</b> presented in the
standard <b>Examinator report page</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>MASA MDE Report page</b> has links to two types of reports:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>abnormality score reports</b></li>
  <li><b>wafer result reports</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Abnormality score reports</font></b></p>
<p><b>Abnormality score histogram report</b></p>
<p>This report displays an histogram of the MDE abnormality score distribution
over the analysed data set. Normal data have low scores while abnormal data have
high scores. The histogram bins that contain <b>abnormal data are shown in red</b>.
If the analyzed dataset is statsitically equivalent to the reference dataset
used initially to train the MDE model, this histogram will be flat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A link to an interactive view of the same data is provided, which allows for
a closer examination of the distribution. Another way to look at the same data is
provided by the <b>abnormality score trend</b> report.</p>
<p><b>Abnormality score trend report</b></p>
<p>This report displays a trend chart of the MDE abnormality scores over the
analysed data set. Normal data have low scores while abnormal data have high
scores. Each x-coordinate corresponds to a wafer. <b>Abnormal wafers have scores
above the red line</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A link to an interactive view of the same data is provided, which allows for
a closer examination of the distribution. Another way to look at the same data is
provided by the <b>abnormality score histogram</b> report.</p>
<p>Use the <b>wafer
result report</b> and <b>wafer summary reports</b> to individually examine the abnormal (and normal) wafers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Wafer result reports</font></b></p>
<p><b>Wafer score report</b></p>
<p>The <b>wafer score report</b> displays the list of wafers that have been analyzed
together with their MDE
abnormality scores. Abnormal scores appear <b>on a red background</b> in the
report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This report provides links to the <b> wafer summary reports</b> of all tested wafers.</p>
<p><b>Wafer summary reports</b></p>
<p>A <b>wafer summary report</b> is generated for each tested wafer. The page
header displays the <b>lot ID</b>, <b>wafer ID</b> and <b>MDE abnormality score</b>
of the wafer.</p>
<p>The remaining of the page presents the different tests by descending order of <b>deviation
to reference</b> (called a Z-Score, a measure of univariate abnormality). Thus, <b>the
most abnormal tests are presented first</b>. For each test, the following
information is displayed:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Test name</b>: current test name</li>
  <li><b>Min measurement</b>: minimum measurement for the current test (recall
    that a test can be applied at several locations on the same wafer).</li>
  <li><b>Max measurement</b>: maximum measurement for the current test (recall
    that a test can be applied at several locations on the same wafer).</li>
  <li><b>Z-Score</b>: deviation between the current measurement and the
    distribution of values for the same test over the reference dataset used
    initially to train the MDE model. If the test is applied at several
    locations, then the location with the worst Z-Score is considered.</li>
  <li><b>Reference mean</b>: mean of the distribution of values for the current
    test over the reference dataset used initially to train the MDE model. If
    the test is applied at several locations, then the location with the worst
    Z-Score is considered.</li>
  <li><b>Reference standard deviation</b>: standard deviation of the
    distribution of values for the current test over the reference dataset used
    initially to train the MDE model. If the test is applied at several
    locations, then the location with the worst Z-Score is considered.</li>
</ul>
<p>This report also provides links to the <b>''histograms of tests'' report</b>
and from there to the associated <b>univariate analysis results</b>.</p>
