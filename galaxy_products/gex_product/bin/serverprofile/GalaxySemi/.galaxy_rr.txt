# o Any line starting with the '#' is a comment line and is ignored.
# o Each line is evaluated, and if true, defined reports background colors.
# o All lines are always evaluated.

# Format:
# If <Expression> Then Color = <BackgroundColorType>
#
# Example:
# IF R_R < 45 AND Cpk > 1.33 THEN Color = White
# IF R_R > 45 AND R_R < 65 AND Cpk > 1.33 THEN Color = Yellow

# 1) Define default background color in case all other expressions are not verified
IF 1 THEN Color = Red
#
# 2) For Cpk greater than 1.33, the RR should be less than 45% to make it pass
IF Cpk > 1.33 AND R_R < 45 THEN Color = Default
#
# 3) For Cpk between 1.0 and 1.33, the RR should be less than 25% to make it pass
IF Cpk > 1.0 AND Cpk < 1.33 AND R_R < 25 THEN Color = Default
#
# 4) For Cpk less than 1.0, the RR should be less than 10% in order to pass
IF Cpk < 1.0 AND R_R < 10 THEN Color = Default
#
# 5) For Cpk greater than 1.33, and the RR is less than 65%, this is a conditional release
IF Cpk > 1.33 AND R_R < 65 THEN Color = Yellow
#
# 6) For Cpk between 1.0 and 1.33, and the RR is less than 45%, this is also a conditional release
IF Cpk > 1.0 AND Cpk < 1.33 AND R_R < 45 THEN Color = Yellow
