/*!
  This class provides a robust and high performance HTTP upgrade router. It
  allows register AbstractHttpUpgradeHandler objects to handle requests
  that matches the mapping rules. The mapping rules are limited to use regular
  expressions to filter the url path component.

  The type of mapping rules used in this class provides a predictable behaviour
  that is simple to understand and allow the use of caching algorithms to
  improve the performance.

  Did you note that HttpServerRequestRouter is a subclass of
  AbstractHttpUpgradeHandler? This design choice allows you to nest
  routes.

  When the router finds one matching request handler, it will call its
  handleRequest method passing the request and head objects and also the
  captured texts by the regular expression. If the found handler cannot handle
  the request (this is indicated by the return value), the router will continue
  its quest in the search of a worthy handler. If the router fails in its quest
  (when no handlers are found or when none of the found handlers are able to
  respond the request), the handleRequest method in the router returns false and
  the connection remains open. This mean that you should always create a handler
  that closes any request as the last handler in the most top-level request
  router.
