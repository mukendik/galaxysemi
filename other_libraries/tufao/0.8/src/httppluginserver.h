  This class provides a plugin-based request handler. Use it if you need to
  change the running server code without need to restart the appplication.

  It maintains its own set of rules and is as powerful as
  HttpServerRequestRouter (and internally uses it), but, in contrast, exports
  its configuration through a file and will use handlers loaded from plugins.

  The file use a syntax based on the QSettings ini format and can edit it using
  tufao-routes-editor.

  If you want to control when the plugins are reloaded, you must ensure that
  autoreload is false and explicitly call the slot
